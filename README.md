### A terrible slideshow editor, written in React/Vite

The frontend for an already existing Node.js backend for a slideshow editor (similar to Powerpoint). The backend was authored by the staff of COMP6080 at UNSW.

Features implemented include resizable and draggable elements, slide edit history with undo functionality, support for video, text, image, and code elements, and slide navigation + reordering.

## To run
In two seperate terminals:
```
cd backend
npm i
npm start
```
```
cd frontend
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```
